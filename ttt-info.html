      <p style="font-size: 130%;">This project was first created as a way to learn Python, 
        having already had experience in C++ and Java. It was first coded as a terminal program 
        played in the console. This can be viewed in the Github repository linked down below. 
        Some of the program functions were then adapted to run the HTML browser version in PyScript displayed 
        here, but much of it was changed as the browser game uses a grid of buttons that control 
        the game flow. The tic-tac-toe HTML at the Github repo below is fully functional when viewed 
        in browser from the file system. The version in this website's repo has been adapted slightly 
        for formatting, but is functionally the same. It is simply inserted into this website using iframe.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size: 130%;">This tic-tac-toe game has PvP and PvC, and asks for player usernames 
        to save scores for the scoreboard. The CPU score is saved as well. Unfortunately, scores 
        will not be saved when the page is reset. This may be implemented in the future. There is no 
        CPU algorithm for deciding CPU moves yet, as CPU moves are simply random. Have fun in Tic-Tac-Toe!
