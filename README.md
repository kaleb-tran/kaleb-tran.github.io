#Kaleb's Portfolio  

This is the repository for my personal website at https://kaleb-tran.github.io/  
It hosts information about me, featured projects, and links to this github, my LinkedIn, and my Resume.
  
index.html contains the HTML page setup while style.css determines the styling of page components.  
tic-tac-toe.html is a functional tic-tac-toe game inserted into this website to be played and featured. It was developed at https://github.com/kaleb-tran/tic-tac-toe and copied over to this repository.
